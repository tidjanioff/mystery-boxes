# 🎮 Mystery Boxes™

**Mystery Boxes™** is a logic-based grid game where your mission is to uncover all hidden pieces using numerical clues. With only three chances to make a mistake, each move must be carefully considered. Think strategically and trust your deduction skills!

## 🧠 Gameplay Overview

Each tile in the grid displays a number representing how many hidden pieces are adjacent to it — including diagonals. Use this information to deduce the positions of the hidden elements and mark them. You win by correctly identifying all hidden pieces with no more than **three incorrect guesses**.

## 🎯 Objective

- Reveal all the hidden pieces on the grid.
- Use the numbers displayed on opened tiles to deduce where hidden pieces are.
- Avoid making more than **three mistakes** (wrong guesses).
